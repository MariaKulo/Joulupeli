# Christmas game with React

As a school assignment I modified this game made by Rahul Chhode, https://github.com/c99rahul

More information found at https://blog.logrocket.com/using-react-web-games/#creating-balloon-popping-game-react
and the repository cloned from https://github.com/c99rahul/pop-a-balloon

I mainly modified the colours, cursor, image and translated the game to Finnish.

You can play my Finnish Christmas version at https://white-river-06c182303.4.azurestaticapps.net/
